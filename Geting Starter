Basic Structure of an M3U Playlist

    Header Line:
        The very first line must be:
        #EXTM3U
        This indicates that the file is an extended M3U playlist, allowing for additional metadata tags.

    Media Entries:
        Each media entry typically consists of two lines:
            #EXTINF line: Provides metadata about the media (duration, title, etc.)
            URL or file path: Points to the media stream or file.

Example of a Basic M3U Playlist

          

#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:123,Sample Artist - Sample Track
http://example.com/stream1.ts
#EXTINF:210,Another Artist - Another Track
http://example.com/stream2.ts

      

Explanation:

    #EXTINF:duration,Title:
        duration is in seconds (use -1 if duration is unknown).
        Title is the name of the track or stream.
    The URL following the #EXTINF line points to the media source.

Additional Tips:

    Comments: Lines starting with # are comments or metadata. Anything else is considered media URL.
    Encoding: Save the playlist as UTF-8 for compatibility.
    Paths: Use absolute URLs or relative paths, but absolute URLs are preferred for online streams.
